### Files description:

> Seger_etal_JVS_data.RData
 
Dataset containing all objects necessary to execute the following scripts.

> SCRIPT_Figure_1.R

Build the environmental (rainfall, daylength, canopy openness, and temperature) and phenological graphics.

> SCRIPT_Figure_2.R
 
Build the ridge plot representing the percentage of individuals of each species flowering and fruiting, and their phylogenetic relationships.

> SCRIPT_Figure_3_and_4.R
 
Build the scatter plots of the Principal Coordinates of Phylogenetic Structure (PCPS) and the environmental variables of the best-fitted models.

> SCRIPT_Figure_S5.R
 
Build the graphic representing the results of Pearson correlations between all tested environmental variables.

> SCRIPT_Figure_S7.R
 
Build the environmental (rainfall, daylength, canopy openness, and temperature) and phenological graphics organized by dispersal syndrome.

> SCRIPT_Table_1.R
 
Perform the Principal Coordinates of Phylogenetic Structure (PCPS), the model selection procedure, and model significance by computing two null models (site.shuffle and taxa.shuffle).

> SCRIPT_Table_2.R
 
Calculate the phylogenetic signal on flowering and fruiting phenology through the Phylogenetic Eigenvector Regression Analysis (PVR).

> SCRIPT_Table_S6.R

Calculate the contribution of phylogeny, environment, and their shared influence on flowering and fruiting phenology by employing a variance partitioning on PVR.
